bar.lua
=======
Inspired by (a blatant copy of) [romockee](https://github.com/romockee/powerarrow)'s theme.

Notes
-----

 * This file doesn't use icons to display the arrows, instead a 
 [powerline-patched font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline/tree/develop/fontpatcher/) 
 is needed (if you use arch, several packet are available on aur).
 * Icons are not supplied, a proper icon set is needed.
 * For the colors to make sense, the correct order for the rc.lua should be:
    1.  arrowend
    2.  memicon
    3.  memwidget
    4.  upicon
    5.  upwidget
    6.  hddicon
    7.  fswidget
    8.  baticon
    9.  batwidget
    10. neticon
    11. netwidget
